# juice-contracts-v4

Juicebox is a flexible toolkit for launching and managing a treasury-backed token on Ethereum and L2s.

To learn more about the protocol, visit the [Juicebox Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/).

## Develop

`juice-contracts-v4` uses the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) development toolchain for builds, tests, and deployments. To get set up, install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | sh
```

You can download and install dependencies with:

```bash
forge install
```

If you run into trouble with `forge install`, try using `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure that nested submodules have been properly initialized.

Some useful commands:
