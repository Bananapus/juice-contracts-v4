/// @custom:member duration The number of seconds the ruleset lasts for, after which a new ruleset will start. A duration of 0 means that the ruleset will stay active until the project owner explicitly issues a reconfiguration, at which point a new ruleset will immediately start with the updated properties. If the duration is greater than 0, a project owner cannot make changes to a ruleset's parameters while it is active â€“ any proposed changes will apply to the subsequent ruleset. If no changes are proposed, a ruleset rolls over to another one with the same properties but new `start` timestamp and a decayed `weight`.
/// @custom:member weight A fixed point number with 18 decimals that contracts can use to base arbitrary calculations on. For example, payment terminals can use this to determine how many tokens should be minted when a payment is received.
/// @custom:member decayRate A percent by how much the `weight` of the subsequent ruleset should be reduced, if the project owner hasn't queued the subsequent ruleset with an explicit `weight`. If it's 0, each ruleset will have equal weight. If the number is 90%, the next ruleset will have a 10% smaller weight. This weight is out of `JBConstants.MAX_DECAY_RATE`.
/// @custom:member approvalHook An address of a contract that says whether a proposed reconfiguration should be accepted or rejected. It can be used to create rules around how a project owner can change ruleset parameters over time.
